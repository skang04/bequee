<div class="about">
  Best Korean restaurant in San Jose, Beque Korean Grill restaurant in a new plaza off El Camino
  in Santa Clara’s K-town. We were grand opening 2007 full weekend of March. Very sleek and upscale place
   that provides quick and friendly servers. Welcome to ask us if anything else is needed so often that
   you feel bad but not uncomfortable. The tables are granite, the bathrooms have modern kohler sinks, the gas
    grills have downward sucking vacuums, side dishes come out on long dishes, and rice is served by the potful.
   The food was surprisingly good! The prices are not bad for a BBQ place and the servings were not stingy.
   We hope our quality of service and food stays consistent – something most new Korean restaurants fail to achieve
    over the course of a year after opening. Beque Korean Grill is a very clean and upscale Korean restaurant, which
     reminds me of places in LA or Seoul. Refreshing after going to BBQ places that seem old fashioned and country in
      the area. Service is a noticeable plus.</div>
